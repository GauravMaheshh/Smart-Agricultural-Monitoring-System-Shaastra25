### Novel TAC Sensor:  
Inspired by CUPRAC research, the software measures Total Antioxidant Count (TAC) using calibration curves (Trolox reference), offering insights into nutritional value, shelf life, and quality.  
### Weighted Grading System:  
Combines TAC, LAI, crop height, nutrient levels, and pest/disease severity into a scoring function, providing actionable insights and yield optimization.  
### AI-Powered Tools:
1. Proactive Health Monitoring – Real-time disease and pest detection. (Achieved 98\% accuracy in prediction)
2. Market Intelligence – AI-driven price prediction.
3. Holistic Dashboard: Live weather updates, forecasts, and a farmer collaboration hub for data-driven decision-making.

Crop health monitoring using real-time data.
Agricultural data analysis for better decision-making.
Weather forecasting and its impact on agriculture.
The application is designed to be scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, with a focus on leveraging data to help farmers and agricultural professionals.

## Key Features

- Real-time Data Processing: Process agricultural data like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real-time.
- Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use interface for farmers and agricultural experts.
- Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning or statistical methods to predict crop yields, weather patterns, or pest outbreaks.
- Mobile-Friendly: The platform is responsive, making it accessible on mobile devices.  

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Ensures type safety and enhances the scalability of the project.
- JavaScript: Used for dynamic functionalities and features.
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server used to optimize the workflow.
- Node.js: Backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic.
- HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and style of the application.
